### My NestJs Boilerplate
A simple boilerplate to build Rest-APIs with more DX, it comes with validation, prisma and vitest.

This setup already includes the root path alias `@` and uses the [no-relative-import-paths](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-no-relative-import-paths) plugin for eslint to replace relative imports with path imports and the tests are already configured to support path imports.
